# Objective
To create a interactive front-end responsive website that manipulates the data by using dc.js, d3.js and crossfilter. The data will then be interpreted through a series of graphs and charts to give the user great insight on the data moving forward.


# Project’s Core Functionality

Great insights
The main function of the website was to manipulate data to give the user great insight into how the data can benefit them and give them a better understanding of the market. 

Stunning design and slick charts

# Testing
•	Chrome and Microsoft Explorer developer tools were used the most for testing the responsiveness of the interactive website from desktop to mobile and from browser to browser to check for any errors. 

•	The testing was a lot more intense and scrutinised than the first milestone project because there was more variables to work with that all had to work in sync together for the code to run properly.

•     I decided to use a scroll for the graphs on mobile as shrinking down the graph to a very small size would look unattractive on mobile

# Main Content

# Home page

https://anthony-keogh.github.io/bitcoin-front-end-project/index.html

•	Introduction to stock market

•	Explanation of bear and bull market

•	Types of crypto currencies (picure)

# Bitcoin page

https://anthony-keogh.github.io/bitcoin-front-end-project/bitcoin.html

•	Introduction

•	Graphs and charts


# User Experience
•	Each graph is unique in design and function

•	Stunning and professional looking charts that were easy to understand for the user.  Different interpretations of the graphs while overall quality of design was at a high level and eye catching and therefore increase the chances of the user returning.

•	user-friendly
It was critical to make the graphs and charts as user friendly as possible so the user can understand the charts better without getting distracted or turned off by the poor quality of its design and the quality of the charts interaction. 

•	Easy to read and interpret 
If the user finds it hard to read the data on the charts then this will decrease the user experience of the website, so a lot of time and effort was put in to making it a top quality easily read interactive website.

•	Wireframe diagram
I have designed a clear and concise wireframe of how the website will be laid out before I started coding the website. This was to insure i stuck to the main goals and objectives. 


# User Interface

•	The user interface for this website had to be as straightforward and effective to enhance the users enjoying when they browse or interact with the charts.

•	 The website navigation was concise and clear for the user to navigate through different pages and very little jargon was used to avoid user getting confused by too much information.

•	I website design was well crafted and put together for the user to interact with in terms of clicking on various parts of the charts which gives them new insights. 

•	Overall the standard and quality of the website was at a high level which enhanced the user interface and user experience.

# Project Approach
•	Navigation bar
The Navigation bars were all in sync and worked well from page to page without any confusion for the user. 

•	Main body
Apart from the home page, the content was very similar for all the pages to give the user familiarity and a common theme to interactive theme. This will enhance the user’s enjoyment while also lowering the difficulty in understanding the content and persuade them to come back and use the website again.

•	Footer
There was no need to put any real content on the footer as it would take away from the content on the main body of the website as the enjoyment of interacting with the charts was my primary goal.

# Project Deployment
I work on the website through VS code were i tested all functions, features and bugs
I did not need to deploy it locally, but i did deploy through the github pages in settings
